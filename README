This repository includes my old (and some recent) programs 
that I enjoyed both implementing and watching it run.

Older ones (from the time that DrScheme was version 452) 
are modified only to be able to run with recent 
(and decent - not draw.ss!) modules, no modification is 
done beyond that.

- eratostheneSieve.rkt : Implements the Eratosthene's 
Sieve using continuations.

- hanoi-world.scm : Visually solve the Tower of Hanoi 
problem.

- listLengthPowerOfTwo.rkt : Determines if the length 
of the given list is a power of two, without using any 
usual arithmetic operations. (+,-,*,/, etc.)

- lambdaCalculusInterpreter.rkt : A small interpreter 
for a fully bracketed lambda calculus that is capable 
of computing factorial using Y combinator.

- maze-generator : Generates a random maze image using 
basic recursive backtracking.

- nim.rkt : Implements a graphical interface to play 
the classical game Nim.

- gravitation-xy.scm : An old interactive animation 
which implements a naive gravitational pull. (Works 
with up/right/left keys)

- move-to-center.rkt : Small funny interactive 
animation. Jus run and click anywhere.

- scrambler.rkt : A funny random character sequencer.

- str2bin.scm : An old program to convert ascii strings 
to binary and vice versa.
